Developed an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrated features to handle user interactions, manage game state, and determine winning conditions. The game supports both two-player mode and AI mode, allowing users to either play against each other or challenge a computer opponent. With a clean interface and responsive design, it offers an engaging and enjoyable user experience.
